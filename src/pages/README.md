# Pages Folder

Contains all routable entities. Naming this folder _Routes_ instead, wouldn't be too wrong either.
Pages typically don't hold logic rather act as routing target and the very high-level view of the feature.
Setup the layout here using render slots and wrap contents with providers, guards and sometimes also effects.
