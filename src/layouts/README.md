# Layouts folder

This folder is for layout components or rather _pattern_. Your reflex might be thinking of _styled components_ and you would be right. Well, kinda. I mean at least not entirely wrong. I'd like to zoom out one step further here and think layout _patterns_, e.g. _box_, _stack_, _cluster_, _cover_, _center_, etc... One way to implement these is using web-components like [every-layout](https://every-layout.dev/) does, if styled components or even sass mixins are what floats your boat i guess that's fine too.
